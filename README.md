An interactive story hoping to raise awareness on violence towards women and denounce victim blaming. My intention is for the message to become clearer with the number of play-throughs, or if multiple people are playing. Created with Twine (HTML/CSS/Javascript, 5/2022).  

P/s: Twine does not allow for easy file organization, so the code was exported as a chunk of HTML â˜¹.
